Double_loop.py
I learnt how to use 2 dimensional loops and I printed out different characters in a 5x5 grid. On top of that I also built a staircase of characters and then reversed it. The outer loop represents the rows and the inner loops represents the collums. 


Loops.py
I learned about how to use for loop. Objective of this program to write multiple of 5 and appending(write an element in list) the elements in an array called 'table'.
In order to read the element I used table[index]. 

Append.py
This Python script generates and prints the first 10 multiples of 7. It uses a for loop to iterate from 0 to 9, and in each iteration, it adds 7 to a variable called mult. The updated value is then appended to a list named numbers and immediately printed. By the end of the loop, the list contains the numbers 7 through 70, increasing by 7 each time. This is a simple example of using loops and lists in Python.

Find_Number_Tuple.py
I learnt how to take user input and check if it exists in a tuple using a loop. I used a flag variable to keep track of whether the number was found. The program compares the input number with each element in the tuple using a for loop. If the number is found, the flag is changed to "YES". At the end, it prints out whether the number exists in the list or not. This helped me understand how conditionals and loops work together in a search operation.
