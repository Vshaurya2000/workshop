Double_loop.py
I learnt how to use 2 dimensional loops and I printed out different characters in a 5x5 grid. On top of that I also built a staircase of characters and then reversed it. The outer loop represents the rows and the inner loops represents the collums. 


Loops.py
I learned about how to use for loop. Objective of this program to write multiple of 5 and appending(write an element in list) the elements in an array called 'table'.
In order to read the element I used table[index]. 

Append.py
This Python script generates and prints the first 10 multiples of 7. It uses a for loop to iterate from 0 to 9, and in each iteration, it adds 7 to a variable called mult. The updated value is then appended to a list named numbers and immediately printed. By the end of the loop, the list contains the numbers 7 through 70, increasing by 7 each time. This is a simple example of using loops and lists in Python.
