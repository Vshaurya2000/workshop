Double_loop.py
I learnt how to use 2 dimensional loops and I printed out different characters in a 5x5 grid. On top of that I also built a staircase of characters and then reversed it. The outer loop represents the rows and the inner loops represents the collums. 


Loops.py
I learned about how to use for loop. Objective of this program to write multiple of 5 and appending(write an element in list) the elements in an array called 'table'.
In order to read the element I used table[index].
